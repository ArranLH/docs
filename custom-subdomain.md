# Custom subdomain

At the moment, we do not support the adding of custom domains directly from the Radiopanel interface.

However, we can still add custom domains manually, Get in touch if you're interested in a custom domain for your Radiopanel instance, ensure you have the "customization" feature enabled, then please contact Felikx\#0001.

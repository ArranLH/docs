# Spotify matching service

You will need to create a Spotify developers account. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/ and click on Dashboard
Once you are there, press "Create an App"
Name it whatever you want. It doesn't matter.

Once created, it will redirect you to the spotify app dashboard. You will need to get your Client ID and Client Secret.

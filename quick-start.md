# Quick Start

## Registration

Register for a radiopanel account on: [http://app.radiopanel.co/auth/register](http://app.radiopanel.co/auth/register)

## Radio station creation

After you registered, you will be presented with the option to create a new radio station. Press "Create Radio Station"

## Setting up your song history

After your radio station creation you will be automatically assigned an admin role that has all the permissions enabled. To setup your song history you first have to provide your stream status URL & choose a matching service.

Go to "Settings" in the left hand side menu \(you might have to scroll down\); and fill in the following things:

* Stream type
* Steam status URL \(more info \(here\)\[/stream-status-url\]\)
* Matching service \(more info \(here\)\[/matching-services\]\)

After you filled these things in correctly and saved your changes you should start to see your song history fill up after a minute.
